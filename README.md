### Keeping the Growth Mindset 
>**"The growth mindset can open pathways to more creativity and possibility, and enable the setting of higher goals and more achievement."** ([Haffenden,2020](https://pages.github.com/))

>Simply put defeat can be a hard pill to swallow. I find myself at times stagnant when it comes  to goals that I have set forth in my personal and proffesional life. After reading this article, I can say I am a text book description of all the red flags presented, which in turn tend too stop me from acheiving success and my full potential .
>For example, losing focus, avoiding challenges,( sometimes our assignments )  or even ignoring criticism positive or negative it all adds up to one thing! Absolutly no growth, accountability or longevity, both proffesionally and personally.
>What I have sumarized or equated the Growth Mindset is to be be open to new ways of learning , staying agile, and not being afraid to fail or have the right the answer. Just as we are born into the world a blank canvas, we are (painted) taught by our parents, mentors, and teachers, we should look at the growth mindset in the same depth. In order to grow there must be a willingness to learn.

A few things that I will be doing to ensur that I can stay in this current growth mindset ....

1. Changing ~~can't~~ to can!
2. Speaking more often with my peers, TA's and  teachers  which ensure that I am utilizing the tools that I am given
3. Stop avaoiding the issue and make a plan to conquer each task piece by piece
4. Thinking about the affects of long term success as opposed to momentary distress and impulse quitting
5. Thinking about wht I have learned instead of focusing on what I didnt know and making plans to improve full cirlce
